# README, Lei, 07/30/2013

This directory contains:
 
(1) IDL scripts to generate inputs of GEOS-Chem planeflight diagonstics
    
  get_dc8.pro		: IDL script to get DC-8 location and time, 
			: called by make_planeflight.pro, if necessary

  get_er2.pro		: IDL scirpt to get ER-2 location and time,
			: called by make_planeflight.pro, if necessary

  make_planeflight.pro	: Main script to make Planeflight files

(2) Aircraft Navigation (NAV) files

  ER2/			: ER-2 NAV files
  DC8/			: DC-8 NAV files

(3) Planeflight.hdr	: List of tracers to be saved, 
			: used by make_planeflight.pro

(4) output/		: Dir for saving Planeflight files,
			: Should be known by GEOS-Chem

(5) planelog/		: Save planelog files from GEOS-Chem

To run the scripts:

make_planeflight, 20130531
or 
make_planeflight, 20130531, /upload     

NOTE:
make_planeflight creates input files for 1 day in UTC time only.
If a flight spanned two days in UTC time, make_planeflight should be 
called one for each of these days. For example, if a flight took off
at 1500 UTC on 20130531 and landed and 0100 UTC on 20130601, call
make_planeflight, 20130531
make_planeflight, 20130601

If make_planeflight is called for a day for which there is no flight
data, a blank input file will be created, and this will not have a
detrimental effect on GEOS-Chem at runtime. It is therefore safe to
just loop over all dates from start to end of campaign when creating
these files.
