# README, from Jenny Fisher, updated by Lei Zhu for SEAC4RS.

Description of files within this directory, organized from lowest level function to highest.

1. read_planeflight_and_tracerinfo.pro
Low level routine, not generally called by user. Reads a single plane.log file written by GEOS-Chem. Returns the contents as a structure. Structure tag names are the GEOS-Chem tracer names if the directory with the plane.log file also contains a tracerinfo.dat file.

2. avg_geosgrid.pro
Averages a data structure over the specified grid and time resolution. All of
the fields within the structure are averages. Average calculated with the
mean.

3. planelog2flightmerge.pro
Use this to read plane.log files. (Wrapper for read_planeflight_and_tracerinfo.pro.) After reading the plane.log file or files, this routine renames some of the structure tags more sensibly. It can average spatially and temporally over a GEOS-Chem grid.

4. batch_planelog2flightmerge.pro
Combinees one or more Planelog text files (written by GEOS-Chem) into a plane
structure. Requires inputs for the date of flight or flights.

--The following files are specific to SEAC4RS--
For future campaigns only the following files should need to be changed.

5. seac4rs_model_merge.pro
Driver routine for batch_planelog2flightmerge. This script contains the dates
of SEAC4RS flights.
YOU NEED TO UPDATE THIS FILE TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL FLIGHT DATES!

6. seac4rs_nrt_script.pro
Driver routines for seac4rs_model_merge.pro
These files just contain the names of input (model run directories) and output
directories for seac4rs_model_merge.pro

===================================

Several other things:

1. Before running the scripts, firstly you need to define the SEAC4RS dir (!SEAC4RS) at your idl_startup.pro.

2.Also you need to update IDL/gamap2/gamap_util/ctm_read_planeflight.pro as below:

   ARRSIZE  = 2000L ; Increased by lei, 07/19/13
   VARSIZE  = 150L  ; Increased by lei, 07/23/13, as we have more tracers

   ; Change the format based on planeflight_mod.F, Line 1643
   ; Changed by Lei, 130630
   Fmt = '(6X,A5,X,I8.8,X,I4.4,X,F7.2,X,F7.2,X,F7.2,X,'+ $
          String( N_Data ) + '(e11.3,X))'

3. Make sure you have cdh_tools in your IDL folder, see: /home/lei/IDL/cdh_tools/. We will use several functions from cdh_tools, for example, tapply.pro, mean_nan.pro, scatterplot_datacolor.pro and scatterplot.pro.
You can add a line for IDL_PATH in your idl_startup.pro

   Expand_Path( '+~/IDL/cdh_tools/',/All_Dirs ) + Sep + $

4. Use updated tracerinfo.dat. And change the default tracerinfo.dat path in planelog2flightmerge.pro (Line 109)

      ; Use READ_PLANEFLIGHT_AND_TRACERINFO in order to get standard GEOS-Chem
      ; tracer names rather than default ND40 names
      PLANE = READ_PLANEFLIGHT_AND_TRACERINFO( thisfile,$
      !SEAC4RS+'/IDL/planelog2sav/tracerinfo.dat')

=====================================

To run the code, we need to change flight dates in seac4rs_model_merge.pro by hand, then in IDL type:
.RUN seac4rs_nrt_script
